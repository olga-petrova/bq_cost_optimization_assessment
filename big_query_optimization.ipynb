        "\n",
        "With on-demand pricing, you will generally have access to up to 2,000 concurrent slots, shared among all queries in a single project. Periodically, BigQuery will temporarily burst beyond this limit to accelerate smaller queries. In addition, you might occasionally have fewer slots available if there is a high amount of contention for on-demand capacity in a specific location.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Europe (eu), the price is $6.25 per TiB.\n",

However, when working with a 3rd party consultant from Google or otherwise, it is often the case that they will have a project set up to help with your cost analysis e.g. `consulant-project` that you give access to all your projects that you want to analyse. Then you can use the consulants project as the CONTROL_PROJECT_NAME. Usually when working on this internally, there is only one project for both CONTROL_PROJECT_NAME and INFOSCHEMA_PROJECT_NAME.\n",
